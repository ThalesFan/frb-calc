# Web2.0Calc E2E test

This repository is a simple E2E test written in Cypress for the [web2.0calc](https://web2.0calc.com/) 


The spec file is found [here](cypress\integration\specs\calculator.spec.js),
and the page object file is found [here](cypress\page-objects\calculator.page.js)

To run the tests: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThalesFan/frb-calc.git
```


open a terminal and run:


```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm run cypress:open
```



Obviously there is much room for more testing, but I decided to leave it at that due to lack of time
